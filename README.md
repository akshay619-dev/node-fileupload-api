# Fileupload REST API using node express

This API is build with Multer Storage Engine and  Express Js

## 🛠 Install dependencies

There are some dependancies required for this project  

### `npm i express nodemon multer cors` 


Now you can run:

### `npm run server`

Open localhost:8899 in your browser to see basic node app in action.

These are APIs to be use:

POST	/upload	        ==> upload a File
GET	/files	          ===> get List of Files (name & url)
GET	/files/[filename]	===> download a File

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
